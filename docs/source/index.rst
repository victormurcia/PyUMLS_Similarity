Welcome to PyUMLS-Similarity's Documentation!
==============================================

**PyUMLS-Similarity** is a Python package designed for researchers and developers working
with medical data and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). It simplifies the process
of computing semantic similarity between medical concepts, leveraging a set of sophisticated
Perl modules for deep semantic analysis.

PyUMLS-Similarity offers a Pythonic interface to these tools, making it easier to integrate
into existing Python projects. It's particularly useful in fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP),
bioinformatics, and healthcare data analysis.

For more detailed information, check out the :doc:`usage` section. To get started with the package,
see :ref:`installation`.
